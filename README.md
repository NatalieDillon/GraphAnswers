## Graph exercises

Represent a graph using both an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list</br>
It has been assumed for the moment that the vertices will be a string</br>

1. Implement IGraph using an adjacency matrix. You will need a 2-Dimensional array to hold the edges. Use a list of strings for the vertices</br>
2. Implement IGraph using an adjacency list. You might wish to use a dictionary of dictionaries for this.</br>
3. Test your code, there is some example test code in Program.cs. You may wish to add to this or to create your own unit tests</br>

Extension:
Now create a text file with some example graph data (you might wish to look up some real data such as the travel times between different underground stations) and add code to upload this data into a graph and test it</br>
